# Abstract

> In negative ion sources for the ITER Neutral Beam Injection system, the co-extraction of electrons is one of the main limiting factors. The current of co-extracted electrons can be decreased by applying a positive bias voltage to the Plasma Grid (PG) with respect to its source walls. Simulations using three-dimensional Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Collision (3D-PIC MCC) model are a powerful tool for studying the extraction region of such ion sources. However, the inclusion of both PG and source walls in the simulation domain is difficult due to numerical constraints. This study uses the 3D-PIC MCC code ONIX to explore the effects of particle injection models on plasma characteristics, using a flux injection model to regulate particle influx for a flat transition in potential from the bulk plasma to the simulation domain. Biasing of the PG above floating potential is possible using the flux injection scheme and results in a notable reduction in co-extracted electrons, corroborating with established experimental observations.
