Hi, I’m Max. I work in the [Advanced Computing Hub](https://www.ipp.mpg.de/3987588/ach) at [Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics](https://www.ipp.mpg.de), where I help researchers and engineers get the most out of large-scale computing systems for fusion and plasma physics. My academic background is in plasma physics, and I completed my PhD through a joint program between Augsburg University and Paris-Saclay, focusing on the behaviour negative ion beam formation using a 3D [Particle-in-cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell) model.

This website is a place where I collect the things I work on and the things I enjoy: a selection of my academic articles, ongoing and past open-source projects, as well as logs from my bike trips, travels, and other. It’s part portfolio and part notebook.

My research interests include:

- High-performance computing for plasma and fusion simulations
- Nonlinear plasma dynamics in low-temperature and fusion plasmas
- Scientific visualization and reproducible workflows for large-scale plasma simulations
- Development and maintenance of open-source tools
