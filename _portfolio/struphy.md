**STRUPHY** stands for **STRU**cture-**P**reserving **HY**brid code (or **STRU**cture-preserving **PHY**sics code). The package provides off-the-shelf models for plasma physics problems, such as

* Maxwell's equations
* Magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD)
* Vlasov-Poisson and Vlasov-Maxwell kinetic models
* Drift-kinetic models for strongly magnetized plasma
* MHD-kinetic hybrid models
