The 3D [Particle-In-Cell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell) (PIC) [Monte Carlo Collision](https://www.particleincell.com/2011/mcc/) (MCC) code [Orsay negative ion extraction (ONIX)](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/onix_group/onix) was developed to [simulate negative ion extraction](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0128759) in [ion sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_source) which are dominated by [surface production](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1693327/files/p265.pdf) of [negative hydrogen ions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_anion), which is the case for [caesiated](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2244/1/012057) H−/D− sources for fusion. The ONIX code self-consistently simulates particle transport in a hydrogen or deuterium plasma, including [dissociation](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6587/ac0163), the effect of collisions, and the influence of an external [magnetic filter field](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fusengdes.2013.01.024) and [magnetic deflection field](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fusengdes.2020.111486).
